Launch Alignak-App
==================

On Linux
~~~~~~~~

Once you have configured your application, just type the following in a terminal::

    $HOME/.local/alignak_app/launch

Alignak-app will start, but will also create a command for later. Thereafter, you will only have to type the following command to launch your application::

    alignakapp

If you launch command second times, this will restart application.

On Windows
~~~~~~~~~~

You just have to launch the ``alignakapp.py`` in ``bin`` folder::

    python c:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Python\alignak_app\bin\alignakapp.py

Obviously, for the time it requires to have an open command prompt on Windows. A more complete installer will arrive soon
